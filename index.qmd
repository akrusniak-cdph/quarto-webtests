This is a Quarto website.

To learn more about Quarto websites visit <https://quarto.org/docs/websites>.

As a proof-of-concept, I'm going to test a few different capabilities of the Quarto website. The main things I'm looking for:

-   Ability to nicely organize pages

-   Ability to show static R visualizations

-   Ability to have interactive R visualizations

-   Ability to have interactive leaflet maps

-   Ability to embed visualizations or dashboards from other ecosystems (e.g. PowerBI, Tableau)

-   Ability to achieve semi-complex layouts, with possibly native dashboard elements (perhaps using Shiny?)

```{r}
#| include: false
library(tidyverse)
library(leaflet)
```

#### Static R Visualizations

Here's an example plot, using the `mpg` dataset:

```{r}
#| echo: false
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = cty)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", formula = y ~ x) +
  theme_minimal()
```
